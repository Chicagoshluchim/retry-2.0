# Refactoring Completion Report

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The Shiur Gimmel Summer Mivtzah 2025 app has been successfully refactored from a monolithic script.js into a modular structure. All features are working correctly in the new architecture.

## 🏗️ Final Architecture

```
├── core.js           - Core data management and utilities
├── messaging.js      - Messaging system (student-admin communication)  
├── student.js        - Student dashboard and functionality
├── admin.js         - Admin panel and messaging management
├── main.js          - App initialization and routing
├── index.html       - Main application entry point
└── styles.css       - Styling (unchanged)
```

## 🔧 Final Fixes Applied
